	<span class='quotetext'>"We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning"</span>
    <span class='quotesignature'>--Jean Baudrillard (1985)</span>
</div>

<p>Different interpretations of the material world that we experience through our five physical senses exist everywhere around us.</p>
<p>
For every material object and every physical geographical place, we base our opinions and experiences not only on our own senses and feelings, but on all the different renderings with which we are constantly bombarded from films, music, comics and posters.
We shouldn't neglect to mention how much more these opinions are shaped by the numerous descriptions from the people around us.</p>
<p>On top of all that we can add our personal collections of memories. Memories that consist of past experiences from other very similar or totally different places.</p>

<p class='intermission'>
	Index.html is about understanding that every geographical location can be interpreted in unique and interesting ways according to whoever experiences it.
</p>

<p>Sometimes we can be unaware that every inerpretation of our physical reality focuses merely on certain aspects of it. A material object is not just the sum of its attributes, such as its design, material, color or dimensions. Each object is merely a type of container that, in a certain way, stores our experiences of it.</p> 
<p>For example, we can assume that there's a red paper cup in front of us. Someone may release that its color is the same as one of his shirt. Another may notice that the smell of its material is similar to that of a new book. Somebody else could be reminded of one of their own cups. It is apparent that each object gets its very meaning by whoever experiences it.</p>


<p>Those experiences transcend the object from its mere physical attributes to any different interpretation that each individual gives it, and in a way that they can better understand it and communicate it more efficiently. This observation can expand to include spaces and places.</p>

<p class='intermission'>
	Index.html is about acknowleding that spaces and places can be described as indexes to databases.
</p>

<p>
	When we experience a material object we store in our minds only the relative attributes that make an impression on us (very generally speaking). When we try to express what we have experienced, our descriptions are limited to our vocabulary and the understanding of our surroundings, among others.
</p>
<p>
	However educated or descriptive someone can be, it is safe to assume that there always is a lot of information that is being lost in this proccess.
</p>

<p class='intermission'>
	Index.html is about reasearching how inadequate are modern geographical systems to shape our experiences of the environment.
</p>

<p>
	Modern digital applications that map and catalogue geographical places, such as the <span class='bold'>Google Maps Api</span>, provide a very two dimensional (2D) rendering of world. A certain amount of important information is being filtered and omitted from these systems. However, we do understand that the importance of the different information is strictly in the eye of the beholder. 
</p>

<div class='quoteright'>
	<span class='quotetext'>"The map is not the territory"</span>
    <span class='quotesignature'>--Alfred Korzybski (1931)</span>
</div> 

<p>
	Even though these systems use image captures, provide accurate and true information of each place as well as interesting statistics and other relevant information, they give us an almost disconected understanding of our reality.
</p>
<p>
	A place is not restricted to its street number, or the buildings (if any) that it includes. It also consists by the perceptions and thoughts of the people passing by it, the various emotional experiences that they have in different times of the day, and even the its smells.
</p>
<p>No modern application can possibly provide its users with all this torrent of personalized information.</p>

<p class='intermission'>
	Index.html is about experimenting on ways to enrich the representation of data that refer to our surroundings.
</p>

<p>We set out to create database, of sorts, that will not only contain basic geographical information of a selected area, but also the experiences that people have when they walk from these places.</p>
<p>Regardless of their flaws, the modern digital applications proved to be very inspiring in the way that they organize and save their data and how they represent certain aspects of our world.</p>
<p>We kept in mind the merits of these applications and instead of creating a digital database that relies on a software application to import and export the data, we decided to play around with the idea of an "analogue" database. A database that would consist of tangible, "molecular" material, and its data would be, among others, experiences of people. 
</p>

<p class='intermission'>
	Index.html is about creating a physical map to act as a database filled with sounds, smells, emotions and visions that people experienced while walking in a selected area in Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
	When the database was created, the team members with the help of volunteers set out to collect and document their experiences from the selected area, according to our instructions. Those experiences were documented in the form of words, or else, tags.  After organizing the tags, we appended them on the map, depending on the time of day and the geographical position that they were collected.
</p>

<p class='intermission'>
	Index.html is about implementing unique ways to express data and export information.
</p>
<p>
	The next part of the project was to figure out digital and non-digital ways to express the data that we stored in the database. Each of these ways would provide another layer of information that we believe is missing from the modern digital applications.
