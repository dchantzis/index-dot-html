<p>There is always a difference between the physical object and the interpretation of the object. The same as map which represent our surroundings. But normal maps just simply collects geographical information and plainly illustrated location of buildings and direct of roads in a 2 dimensional aspect but nothing more. In this circumstance, our project is trying to interpreter a certain area in a more depth and comprehensive way which including emotion, sound and vision.</p>

<p>The concept of index.html project is to digitize the environment, transform the raw database of an area which including locations, emotions and sounds into digital database and then represent it in digital way. That means we will supplement our experience of places with other media and then produce an interpretation of the places.</p>

<p>The aim of index.html project is to interpret space and use network data to represent environments; to represent complex spatial and temporal database in creative context, extend graphic and aural techniques aspects. In order to achieve our aim, we selected a geographical area with Alison House as a center and invite as groups of people to experience these routs. Then we tidy and classify these databases like filling these feelings by colorful tags cataloguing experiences. For each path, the combination of tags helps us to form an interpretation and impression of that physical place. Each path is perceived as a data table, that is to say the whole map that with over ten paths in it is a storage space with different types of experiences in it.</p>

<p>Everyone has different impression and interpretation about a region. Even for same area, emotions are variable and changeable in different time and for different people.</p>

<p>My part is trying to use flash to represent these databases in a detail way which including time, emotion and sense in it. The outcome of my part is an interactive flash that will interpret geographical information in a deeper and more dynamic way. It is not only going to be on 2-dimentional, but with depth and interaction in it which will based on time, sense and emotion with more details and information in it. It will be an electronic emotion map for a certain area.</p>

<p>The way to express emotions will based on time, sense as well as positive and negative emotions. And the content in flash is base on the first step database i.e. the map on the wall. In order to express the raw database with more depths and details, we classified the time tag into morning (white tags), afternoon (yellow tags) and evening (night tags), splits sense tags into olfaction, audition, feeling and vision and divided emotion tags into positive and negative emotion.</p>

<p>Since my focus will be on graphic style and how to use graphic method to combine graphic element and raw database, so I m trying to use graphic language to help users to explore the emotion map of our campus and understand the information we want to express.</p>

<p>In time part of flash, I use white to represent the area that people’s emotion more activate in morning time, use yellow to symbolize the rout which got more tags in afternoon and use blue to express night rout; and then express this rout tags in a 3D way that is not only according to map which is 2D, but deeper than map that people can easily know how this road really look like, where has a block, where needs turn right or left. Also, I try to tidy the data and find the most popular rout in this area which means there are more people record their feelings in this rout or that means this area is easier to activate people’s emotion.</p>

<p>In the second part, I create a sense map. In this section, I catalogue the databases according to what you see, what you hear, what you smell and what you feel like. And each sense has a covered area. Like in olfaction area, it has nice perfume, petrol fumes and so on. In audition area, there are birds singing, baby cry, vehicle sound. So, once you click the particular button, you can easily get what people’s sense about the selected area.</p>

<p>In emotion part, I used positive and negative emotion to classify these tags. And it is easy to tell which place have negative emotion and where has positive, also, it is clear that which spot is the central spots of negative emotions with pressure, upset, tired around it as well as positive spot with tags record happy, pleasant, and nice.</p>

<p>I hope people can got these emotion information at the first glance when they click the correspond button of flash. And what they got is not the raw information that what people write on papers, not the information on the paper map, but the information that has been digitalized and processed.</p>

<p>Of course, our statistic is not one hundred percent accurate, but so far we just chose a small area to express our idea and give a basic concept of our project.</p>
