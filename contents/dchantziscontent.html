<p>From our first meeting as a team, it was apparent that the project had a very challenging theme for us to tackle: A way to express feelings and experiences of our surroundings, as well as finding a way to incorporate the very strange parameter of memory which was referenced in the project proposal.
</p>

<p>
Luckily we quickly came up with the idea of creating a unique and innovating physical database that will store a large number of different and unusual data. 
</p>
<p>
The concept was to implement an “analogue” map that would contain a selected area of the city, one that is commonly used by us,  and would serve as a database to peoples' experiences. 
</p>
<p>
People would walk from predefined paths, and document their experiences in the form of tags.  These tags will refer to visual, audio, smell, and emotional stimuli about the surrounding during each walk. In this way we would try to create unique geographical system that would store more personalized information.
</p>
<p>
Those experiences would be filtered and transformed to data, that we would paste on the map, depending on the locations that they were documented. (More information about the production of the map can be found in the <span class='orange2'>"02: The Map"</span> section.)
</p>
<p>
We deceided that the whole team will work together for the production of the map and the process of  collecting, organizing and filling it with data. When the database was filled with enough data that we would be able to use and extract results, each team member will reference the database and the way its organized to create different interpretations of walks.
</p>
<p>
I worked on the design of the printed map and eventually used image captures from Google Earth to create a mosaic of buildings and geographical places that depicted our selected area.
</p>
<p>
After the map was printed and pasted on the message board in the Alison House building, we decided to use threads to reference all the available paths and each tag would be appended on the threads. I spend a lot of time with the installation of the paths and destinations and the rest of the group helped with the collection of tags as well as pasting them on the map. <br />
We managed to create and fill an very interesting “analogue” database and with the help of volunteers we filled the database with the much needed data. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover I focused on the documentation website, creating a flexible and austhetically interesting layout design that would do justise to the unique nature of the proejct. 
As part of the website work, I had to organize all the documentation media of the project (images, videos and text) as well as writing all the website contents.
</p>

<p>
While the rest of the team members were busy working with their mini-projects, I decided to continue working on the database map, since i found that the data were not nearly enough to export the results that I wanted. This decision helped me to came up with a very interesting and appealing idea to utilize the analogue database. Considering that I'm an informatics engineer with knowledge and experience with working on relational digital databases, I had little interest in creating yet another system that would export statistics from data.
</p>
<p>
What interested me more, was to gain more experience in graphic design. Consequently I decided to use my philosophy and tactics of coding algorithms, to interpret the database contents in a very creative way.
</p>
<p>Consequently, I managed to produce a number of graphic visualizations that demonstrate the diversity of the database.
	(Images <a href='#image0501' class='orangelink'>05.01</a>, <a href='#image0502' class='orangelink'>05.02</a>, <a href='#image0503' class='orangelink'>05.03</a>, <a href='#image0504' class='orangelink'>05.04</a>, <a href='#image0505' class='orangelink'>05.05</a> and <a href='#image0506' class='orangelink'>05.06</a>). 
</p>
<p>For images 05.02 through 05.06, I wrote the appropriate code and executed it manually. Meaning that I followed each step of the algorithms the same way that a programmming language interpreter would, in order to produce the wanted result. My results were designed in Photoshop.</p>
<p>
I used photographs from our selected area, as backgrounds of the illustrations to provide a "grounded to reality" aesthetic.
</p>

<p>
During the last preparations for the official presentation of index.html, I came up with a fun idea to emulate the zoom-in effect featured in the Google Maps Api. (Image <a href='#image0507' class='orangelink'>05.07</a>)
</p>
<p>
Considering that the Atrium pillars inside the Alison House, hide a part of the map, I printed again the concealed part. Afterwards I pasted it on the first pillar, in such a way that from a certain distance, the viewers would get a complete view of the map.
</p>
<p>Similarly I applied the same logic to the two remaining pillars that were too right in front of the map, but this time with the scalled printed map in its entirety. </p>

<p>
The decision of the team to work on separate mini projects, for the second interation of the production might not have been the right one. With better organization and
a more focused idea, I believe that we could have created possibly a more substantial and entertaining result.
<br />
However, our development process enabled us to work freely and research in depth different ways to interpret and visualize the data from our database.
