<p>An important step of the index.html production was to select a most appropriate geographical area to base our research on. An area which contains places and buildings that we could use as database tables, as well as use it for our data collection. The area would have to be familiar, accessible and very commonly used by us and our volunteers.
</p>
<p>Moreover, it would have to include buildings and places that they could find aesthetically interesting regardless of the day time. That way we could have some control regarding the diversity of the incoming data.</p>

<p>The area that we found most appealing, has the Alison House building (<span class='address'>12 Nicolson Square, Edinburgh, EH8 9DF</span>) at its center and includes places such as the University Library, The McEwan Hall, The Old College and the University Sports Center.</p>

<p>For representing this area as a database, instaid of creating a digital application that would utilize a relational database, we decided to deviate from the "digital traditional approach" and experiment with creating a physical, tangiable database out of paper.</p>

<p>This database has the form of a map that measures <span class='bold'>2523mm x 1189mm</span>! To create it, we used screen captures taken from the Google Earth application, and pasted them together in Photoshop. The  map was pasted on a board inside the Alison House building and from that point on it became our base of operations.</p>

<p>After figuring out everything regarding the representation of the database, we had to come up with a way to interpret and insert the data to it, in a way that is both versatile and easy. It would also had to allow us working with a huge amount of data, that would not too be difficult and time consuming to insert, as well as organize.</p>

<p>The data that we needed were:
    	<ul>
        	<li>the <span class='bold'>starting point</span>, <span class='bold'>route</span> and <span class='bold'>destination</span> for each walk</li>
        	<li><span class='bold'>visual</span>, <span class='bold'>audio</span>, <span class='bold'>smell</span> and <span class='bold'>emotional</span> stimuli about places that people have passed by and documented. Volunteers take notes of that stimuli in the form of words or short phrases, and we refer to them as <span class='bold'>tags</span>.</li>
            <li>the <span class='bold'>time of day</span> for each walk</li>
        </ul>
</p>

<p>Since the base of operations was the Alison House, and the majority of volunteers where other classmates, it was a natural decision to have all the walks start from Alison House. These walks could have as an ending point each one of <span class='bold'>13</span> different destinations. The selected destinations seem to be the most common places that students visit or pass by.</p>
<p>With the start point and destinations all figured out, the available routes were now very obvious! Pins where stuck on the destinations and on selected positions on each path. These pins were utilized to hold the threads that represent each path.</p>

</li>

</ul>
<div class='clear'></div>


<p>Each one of the walks is represented with different number of small papers, depending on the number of tags that each volunteer decided to document. These pieces of paper were appeneded on the threads of each path and in that way describe them.</p>
<div class='floatright'>
<div class='mediatitlesmall'>02.05: Example of tags</div>
<a class='imglink' href='./images/fullsize/2010.03.24/IMG_3004.jpg' target="_blank"><img src='./images/fullsize/2010.03.24/IMG_3004.jpg' width='165px' class='' alt='emptymap' /></a>
</div>
<p>The day time that every tag was documented, is "saved" in the form of differently colored papers, on which the various tags are written on.</p>
<p>The color <span class='bold'>beige</span> represents morning walks, <span class='bold'>yellow</span> is for evening walks and <span class='bold'>blue</span>is used for the afternoon.</p>

<p>After all the walks were completed and the database was filled with tags, we were ready to export the data and present them, each of us, in different ways through seperate projects, all relevant to the themes of the project that we all set.</p>

<p>In order to keep our mini projects relevant to the main project and not get side-tracked, we repeatedly went back to the database map to reference the way it stores data, 
as well as additional inspiration.</p>
