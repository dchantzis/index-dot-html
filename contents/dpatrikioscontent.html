<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The objective of this project was to interpret our world as an index for a database and then come up with a digitalized outcome, but we focused on how people interpret their surroundings and link them with their memories. Every material object, every physical geographical place is a sum of its attributes, like design, material, colour, height or even the shadows that are being created from that object. When people connect their experiences of the object, with their senses then the user interprets and compiles his thoughts into words (=data). The MAP (which is our database) is the result of a network of people (people who worked on this and people who volunteers), locations and sounds all link together.</p>

<h2>The MAP and the working process.</h2>

<p>Alison House and the Atrium, hosted our MAP as part of the DMSP project 2009-10. The MAP-database was created using only obsolete technology. The MAP is made out of three A0 paper, mounted on the wall and threaded or punctuated with paths and destinations. At the end the wall was and still is a mess but as it is with every database. We choose this approach because it looks better, it is more interactive and funnier, but it also gives the user the chance to explore another dimension, the depth-the proximity.</p>

<p>Index.html is about acknowledging that every physical place is a database. We catalogued, organized and presented those experiences in the form of an interactive material map of a specified area. We created order from chaos; we created a colorful and messy analogue database but also is easy on the eye. We took a literal stance on mapping by getting people’s tags from various paths and locations. Our perception of urban space is based on the human senses.</p>

<p>We sent people to miscellaneous paths and locations around the campus to write down tags (based on their senses). This map can bring to light various things as places of interests, emotional peak points, revile the nosiest points around the campus, the radius of our area, the paths, the destinations, the actual tags, when this tag was written (based on the colour of the paper the tag is written on) and what kind of tag is  (based on the shape that has drawn around it).</p>

<p>Modern digital applications, public art, or exhibitions in galleries that map and catalogue geographical places provide very 2 dimensional. The user is not able to conceive the sense of depth. Although the graphics may be more advanced in the digital form, but at the end everything falls down to where is the fun to all this? Where is the fun to create something that people cannot fiddle with it and maybe alter it? In addition by mentioning depth, I mean the different layers that someone can have with the sound. Despite the fact that sound on its own is a very complex and “deep” material, there is no depth to the interactivity part.</p>

<h2>My methodology and my part in the project</h2>

<p>I tried to implement some of my personal statements to my “digitalized” outcome. The user can interact with the printed MAP, through the use of three sensors. The first gives the sense of distance-depth to the user as the zoom function on a digital map. As the user walks closer to the map is able to hear more and more detailed sounds (from general city sounds to footsteps, breathing and conversations). The second one works independently from the first one. It is specialized for playing back sounds from specific areas - spots of the walks. On the other hand the third one is placed on a different location from the map. This one is used as a trigger, people who are passing in frond trigger a recorder, which records the output and anything that is been played back. The essence of it is for the users to experience someone else’s walk, but also they can modify it by adding their voices, or the background noise through the use of the recorder-player.</p>
